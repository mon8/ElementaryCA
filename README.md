# ElementaryCA
A simple program to generate elementary cellular automata.

This program was written in the Processing language as a final project for an introductory class in Computer Systems.

### How to run
This program can be run through the Processing Development Environment (PDE). It can also be run on Windows without the need for additional software by running the executable file 'ElementaryCA.exe' found inside 'application.windows32'.

### How to use
![Menu page](/images/menu.png)
Above is the menu page. The default rule is Rule 110. [That's an interesting one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110) Click on each condition to alter its respective result. Click the larger tile with the number in it to alter the size of the cells - left-click increases the size, right-click decreases.
When you're ready, press ENTER to generate your elementary cellular automata.
