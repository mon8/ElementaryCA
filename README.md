# ElementaryCA
A simple program to generate elementary cellular automata.

This program was written in the Processing language as a final project for an introductory class in Computer Systems. This is the first project I have completed as part of my Computer Science degree at Maynooth University, as well as my first project written in Processing.

### How to run
This program can be run through the Processing Development Environment (PDE). It can also be run on Windows without the need for additional software by running the executable file 'ElementaryCA.exe' found inside 'application.windows32'.

### How to use

Above is the menu page. Click on each condition to alter its respective result. Not sure what this means? Learn about elementary cellular automata and how rules are classified [here](https://mathworld.wolfram.com/ElementaryCellularAutomaton.html). See that tile with the number inside it? Click that to alter the size of the cells in your cellular automata (the size is given in pixels<sup>2</sup>).
When you're ready, press ENTER to generate your elementary cellular automata.
