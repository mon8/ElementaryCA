# ElementaryCA
A simple program to generate elementary cellular automata.

This program was written in the Processing language as a final project for an introductory class in Computer Systems. This is the first project I have completed as part of my Computer Science degree at Maynooth University, as well as my first project written in Processing.

Authors of any non-original code segments are cited within the source code using comments.


This program can be run through the Processing Development Environment (PDE). It can also be run on Windows by downloading the 'application.windows32' folder and running the executable file 'ElementaryCA.exe'.
