# ElementaryCA
A simple program to generate elementary cellular automata.

This program was written in the Processing language as a final project for an introductory class in Computer Systems. This is the first project I have completed as part of my Computer Science degree at Maynooth University, as well as my first project written in Processing.

Authors of any non-original code are cited within the source code using comments.
