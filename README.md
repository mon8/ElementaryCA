# ElementaryCA
A simple program to generate elementary cellular automata.

This program was written in the Processing language as a final project for an introductory class in Computer Systems.

### Using the program
![Menu page](/images/menu.png)
Above is the menu page. The default setting is Rule 110, [which is quite an interesting one.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110) Click on each condition to alter its respective result. Click the larger tile with the number in it to alter the size of the cells - left-click increases the size, right-click decreases.
When you're ready, press ENTER to generate your elementary cellular automata.

Above is the result for Rule 30 with a cell-size of 1.
